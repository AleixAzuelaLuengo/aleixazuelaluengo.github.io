                <h1>Game Design</h1>     
                <p>One of the first things that I did during the development of Apart, was to do research and gather information about multiple titles across diferent generes. The idea was to, from this research, come up with the initial idea of the game we were gonna build for our dissertation.<br><br>
                After the initial research and pitch, we researched the market for further reference inside the 2D Puzzle-Platformer genere, comming with the initial proposal for our game.</p>

            <div class="about-col">   
                <p>On this first version we put together, we attempted to have a Puzzly yet faily fast-paced Platforming Gameplay, heavily inspired by Braid. <br><br>This can be seen on our main mechanic, being able to create shadows of your past movements. Though our mechanic came with a small twist, you need a Tree with Fruits to record your shadows. <br><br>With this constraint, we wanted to both differentiate ourselves from Braid, and add an extra element to be able to play with for the Puzzles of the game. From there we iterated, evolving our product to the one you'll see here   </p>

            <div class="about-col">
                <h1>Level Design</h1>     
                <p>In Apart's Levels, we followed the CCST Level Design framework, dividing every level into short challenges, surrounded by periods of relative safety. The challenges have to be coherent with eachother. In order to achieve that we evolve or expand the challenges. <br><br> When we expand a challenge, as the name suggests, we add new interactions of the same mechanic we were already seeing in that challenge.

            </div>
            <div class="about-col">   
                <p> When we evolve a challenge, we add new machanics that are involved into that challenge. <br><br>
                    All of these challenges we see throughout a level, culminate into a Climatic Challenge, where we will see all the mechanics that have been used on previous challenges converge. <br><br>
                    Before we start making levels though, we're going to need some ground rules, or also known as Level Pillars.

                <h1>First Steps</h1>     
                <p>Our first Pillar was that we were going to have 3 different meassurements for the challenges: short, medium and long distance. These meassurements were applied for all character movement, which included the jump, knockback, whip and wall-jump.
                <br>Inside the level we also could find 3 different sizes for platforms, small, medium and long. <br> <br>
                    The objecttives of these measurements was to have a level of cohesion across all challenges that went further than what challenges were present in the level. These meassurements also helped us achieve a coherent dificulty progression.

            <div class="about-col">   
                <p> Once these were set, I started working on a macrostructure of how the levels would look, to be able to coordinate with tthe Artists and land on a sweet spot, that allowed a good artistic development and an interesting setup for the levels. <br><br>
                    Two proposals were drafted, one forest and one village, due to a lack of artistic resources, and we went for the Ruins of a Temple.<br><br>
                    These ruins followed a pyramid structure that the levels would follow and climb up to.
